# Mouse Brain Protein Database
This is a project for the course "Introduction to Biotechnology" for the specialization of "Bioinformatics - Biomedical Data Science" of the MSc program ["Data Science & Information Technologies"](https://dsit.di.uoa.gr) offered by the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
It involves the creation of a database for mouse brain proteins.
The database was hosted in MongoDB, which is a no-SQL database.
Data were manipulated using python programming language and the `pymongo` library for a seemless updating of the database.

Collaborative project with: Izabella Gogaeva, [Eleni Panagiotopoulou](https://github.com/eleni-pan), and [Marintina Stamati](https://github.com/Marintina).
